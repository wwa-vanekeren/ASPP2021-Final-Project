# Repository ASP - WE

In this repository you can find and follow the progress of my project for the course Advanced Scientific Programming.

The goal of this project is to apply the concepts shown during the lectures, such as improve documentation, add proper test functions, optimize code for speed.

In this particular project I will improve existing python scripts used to analyze cycling data for batteries. 
In these scripts different text/excel files are read, analyzed and plotted in python. 
The ultimate goal is to develop standardised scripts for handling data from different potentiostats. 
I will improve the structure and organization of existing scripts analyzing the experimental data, and hopefully optimize the code for speed/memory usage.
The project will focus on creating a standardized script/template for one of the potentiostats, which can be used for other potentiostats as well.
