Repository for the course Advanced Scientific Programming

In this repository yuo can find and follow the progress of my project for the course Advanced Scientific Programming.

The goal of this project is to apply the concepts shown during the lectures, such as:

- Improve documentation
- Add proper test functions
- Optimize code for speed/memory usage

I will add a more detailed description of my project later.
