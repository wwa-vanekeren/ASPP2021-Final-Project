# Advanced Scientific Programming - WE
Repository for the course Advanced Scientific Programming

In this repository you can find and follow the progress of my project for the course Advanced Scientific Programming.

The goal of this project is to apply the concepts shown during the lectures, such as:

- Improve documentation
- Add proper test functions
- Optimize code for speed/memory usage

In this particular project I will improve existing python scripts used to analyze cycling data for batteries. 
In these scripts different text/excel files are read, analyzed and plotted in python. 
The ultimate goal is to improve the structure and organization of the scripts analyzing the experimental data, and hopefully optimize the code for speed/memory usage.
If time allows, I will also include a new script which reads/plots and analyzes the data of new equipment I use for experiments (where I apply some of the learned techniques - such as classes, pandas, pytables).
